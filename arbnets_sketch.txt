Write abstract

- Arbitrageurs complements or substitutes?
- Arbitrageurs are endogeneously "vertical" or "horizontal" competitors based on the topology of the network and the structure of noise trade
- Market power can lead to under- or over-entry relative to the efficient/(competitive) benchmark
- Depends on the nature of competition

- Competition in IO as a baseline
- What is the nature of competition between financial arbitrageurs?
	- How is it influenced by the unique industrial structure of financial markets influence
- What are the implications for competition policy, applied to arbitrageurs in financial markets?
	- Cite Taisiya's concentration paper
	- Cite antitrust lawsuits against arbs

MODEL DEFENSE:
- Need a notion of costly "arbitrageur entry". It is natural to make this continuous. Risk limits; capital costs;
	- Cite limits to arbitrage literature
	- Risk limits are from basis risk between imperfectly designed instruments (can cleverly cite the Fischer Black arb paper)
	- Can cite the CIP deviations paper for capital costs
- Our "nodes" are generally financial "products"
	- Big list of examples of "node chains"
	- From actual exchanges/venues, to more abstract "related financial products"
	- Pairs trading in equities
	- Restrictions on link drawing:
		- VIX ETF to VIX, VIX to options, options to SP500
		- FX "ring structure" supporting existence of a core-periphery network, bc periphery nodes are hard to arb against each other logistically
- Arbs reasonably are concentrated in a midrange of concentration in financial markets in practice
	- Ranging from 3 (Taisiya)
	- To like 10 (FX markets)
	- "Large" arbs exist, like Citadel
- Reasonable to model absorbing nodes has having some kind of capacity
	- Closing of price gaps in crypto (cite me)
	- Examples in dealer markets, CIP, etc.
	- Umang Khetan's JMP etc. 

RESULTS:
- Entry can be arbitrarily low, rel benchmarks
	- "chain" example
	- "Middle link" limit as the gamma of the middle link goes to 0
- What happens when there's vertical integration?
- Is there policy around whether integration is allowed? 
	- ETF arbitrage?
	- Bank restrictions on spot crypto
	- Hedge fund restrictions on cross-border arbitrage
	- Foreign markets
	- Prime brokerage restrictions on what's tradable
- "Source"/"sinks" patterns lead to excess entry
- "Chain" patterns lead to under-entry
- In the core-periphery example, there is over-entry if noise is basically "diffusive", and under-entry if it's basically "spoke-to-hubs"

- Market definition and IO:
	- Market definition is already hard!
	- Makes it harder here because industries interact; sometimes "vertically" and sometimes "horizontally"
	- Market definitions are always fluid. In arbitrage networks, the "source" vs "sink" distinction means that there is not a single I-O structure
	- This can be made pretty elegant writing wise
- HORIZONTAL COMPETITION
	- Concentration in "source-sink" pattern markets has tradeoffs. It leads to higher markups. However, it also alleviates entry distortion. 
	- Some degree of competition
	- Competition, combined with a tax on entry, can implement the constrained-efficient benchmark
	- Mimics actually what we see in practice: entry, but with some restrictions, but relatively low HHIs.
- VERTICAL COMPETITION:
	- "Chains" actually benefit from vertical integration
		- CHECK: Cite IO stuff
	- "Internalization" both lowers markups and increases capacity building
	- As in classic literature, overwhelmingly good
	- Crypto exchange: large inefficiencies from lack of vertical integration
- CHECK: Decompose losses into entry/capacity and markup force; classic IO!
